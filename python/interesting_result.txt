Here is an interesting result of our likelihood test.  If the rate of non-infected message transmission does
not depend on the state of the node, when there is not an attacker, we can compute the analytical difference.  Actually, no we can't 
because we don't know how the "data" looks near the... unfinished, unimportant

How to present ROC curves:

In Ipython notebook :
   Present net config
       Need to change s0
       Need to change num_sims_per_processor   
   import from roc.py
        Need to define f function
	
   run the functions
        Need to reshape results
   plot the results
   save the data
   repeat with new net configurations
