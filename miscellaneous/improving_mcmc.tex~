\title{Improving MCMC}

Recall that we are integrating 

\begin{equation}
\int d\bar{z} P(data | \bar{z},s)P(s)P(\bar{z} |s)
\end{equation}

where $s$ is the infection ordering, and $\bar{z}$ are the actual infection times.  Also note that for any $s$ we can explicitely compute $P(s)$.  This is simply the product of the term on the far right of mcmc\_calc.pdf (equation 2 below for convenience).  

\begin{equation}
P(s_2, \bar{z_2} | s_1. z_1 =0)  =
\lambda(1) e^{- \lambda(1) (\bar{z_2} - \bar{z_1})} 
\times \frac{\lambda(1,2)}{\lambda(1)}
\end{equation}

        (from mcmc\_calc.tex)``as in the Gillespie algorithm -- the
	expression on the RHS equals the probability that the first transition
	among all the nodes that are connected to $s_1$ occurs at the time
	$\bar{z_2}$, times the probability that it is node $s_2$ that makes that
	transition). ``
