jg : From now on, let's each work on our own branch and do pull requests
     to master.  It will make it easier to do/undo any changes.  I renamed
     your changes to model.py as a new file (which in hindsight, wasn't
     the easiest way to go about it), but the git tree is a little messed
     up now.  I think PR's will be the best.  To create a branch just do

     git branch dps_branch
     git checkout dps_branch

     The first line creates the branch and the second line switches to it.
